You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight python %}
def print_hi(name)
  print("Hi, " + name)
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

As Kanye West said:

I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.

```ruby
require 'redcarpet'
markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello World!")
puts markdown.to_html
```

```python
def print_hi(name)
  print("Hi, " + name)
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```
